== Blender Auto .MAT Loader ==
I am only responsible for modifications that make this script functional.

This purpose of this script is to utilize the .MAT files provided
when exporting assets from games and simplify the process of connecting
the textures using the Blender API.

Having efficiency in mind, I wanted to offter a level of accuracy that
would give more time to learn other Blender features.

This script can also be re-packaged with any other addon, so long as the
developer respects the limitations ofthe GPL license.

Documentation will become available over time as the project evolves.
In the meantime, a list of all available functions is provided below.
