This purpose of this module is to simplify the use of the Blender API
(bpy) by creating an extra layer of abstraction that is more human-
readable, memorable and reduces the user's exposure to complex code 
paths.
EasyBPY can be added to Blender by installing it into the:
            ../scripts/modules
folder in the user preferences. The file can also be re-packaged with
any other addon, so long as the developer respects the limitations of
the GPL license.

Documentation will become available over time as the project evolves.
In the meantime, a list of all available functions is provided below.
